# Project 2: Narrative Visualization

*Why are Native American tribal schools struggling to meet student needs??*

<br />

## **A. PROSPECTUS**

My project explores the state of **Native American tribal schools** -- K-12 schools that are directly controlled by a tribal nation and serve the young people of that tribe. For years, I have heard stories of these schools struggling to meet student needs, but I have not seen much data to visualize their challenges.

### Data Sources
I analyzed multiple data sources for this project.

1. **Tribal schools metadata:** Initial list was taken from the [Bureau of Indian Education website](https://bie.edu/Schools/), with operators and cities added from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Indian_Education), and latitude and longitude collected manually from Google searches.

2. **Tribal schools scorecard data:** Math and ELA scorecard results were scraped from individual PDFs on the [Bureau of Indian Education website](https://bie.edu/HowAreWeDoing/2015-2016ReportCards/index.htm). Data limited to the 2015-2016 school year.

3. **Per Capita Income by County:** Data taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_counties_by_per_capita_income), and matched to tribal schools.

4. **Tribal schools transportation data:** Per day miles data scraped from Appendix 1-19 to 1-25 in the [2019-2020 Bureau of Indian Education Budget Justifications Report](https://bie.edu/cs/groups/xbie/documents/site_assets/idc2-092115.pdf).
