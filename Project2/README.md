# Project 2: Narrative Visualization

*Why are Native American tribal schools struggling to meet student needs?*

### [**Final Project**](https://koffeeya.github.io/Interactive-Data-Viz-Portfolio/Project2/index.html)

<br />

## **A. PROSPECTUS**

My project explores the state of **Native American tribal schools** -- K-12 schools that are directly controlled by a tribal nation and serve the young people of that tribe. For years, I have heard stories of these schools struggling to meet student needs, but I have not seen much data to visualize their challenges.

### Data Sources
I analyzed multiple data sources for this project.

1. **Tribal schools metadata:** Initial list was taken from the [Bureau of Indian Education website](https://bie.edu/Schools/), with operators and cities added from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Indian_Education). Addresses added manually from Google searches, and latitude and longitude generated in Google Sheets using [this tutorial from Will Geary](https://willgeary.github.io/data/2016/11/04/Geocoding-with-Google-Sheets.html).

2. **Tribal schools scorecard data:** Math and ELA scorecard results were scraped from individual PDFs on the [Bureau of Indian Education website](https://bie.edu/HowAreWeDoing/2015-2016ReportCards/index.htm). Data limited to the 2015-2016 school year.

3. **Per Capita Income by County:** Data taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_counties_by_per_capita_income), and matched to tribal schools.

4. **Tribal schools transportation data:** Per day miles data scraped from Appendix 1-19 to 1-25 in the [2019-2020 Bureau of Indian Education Budget Justifications Report](https://bie.edu/cs/groups/xbie/documents/site_assets/idc2-092115.pdf).

5. **US States GEOJSON:** shapefile for US states taken from previous Interactive Data Visualization tutorials.

### Style Guide

I drew inspiration for the color palette of my project from an image of a tattoo (shown left below) in a book on the Haida people of Alaska. I chose two Google Fonts: [IBM Plex Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans) (for headers and subtitles) and [IBM Plex Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif) (for paragraph text).
