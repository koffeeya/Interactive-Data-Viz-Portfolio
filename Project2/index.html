                    Tribal schools are an important means to preserve and pass on the distinct cultures of Native
                    American
                    people.
                </div>
                <div id="intro-text">But young people in tribal schools, particularly vulnerable populations, face
                    immense
                    challenges in keeping pace with their non-Native peers in academic outcomes. Their schools struggle
                    to
                    find the basic resources, staff, and funding to adequately meet their unique needs.
